# DeepLearning

Contains codes for training various neural network architectures . The reposiroty will be updated from time to time.

The jupyter notebook Deep Feed Forward Neural Network.ipynb , contains codes to train a multi layered feed forward neural network.
The problem of overfitting can be addressed using two techniques : 
        1) Dropout Training (variable dropout_prob can be used to control this. It is the percentage of neurons to be activated at a step of training.
        2) L2 Normalization of weights(variable lam can be used to set the regularization parameter, which has been initialized
                                       to 0.0005)
